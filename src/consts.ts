    Issue Title: ${issue.title}
    
    Issue Body: ${issue.body}

    The document should be in Markdown format. All headings and titles should be in sentence case. Rephrase all content to be clear and concise using correct grammar and spelling. Use active voice. Always describe previous behavior in past tense and new behavior in present tense. Do not use "we" or "our". Refer to the user in the second person (e.g., "you/your"). Avoid colloquial language and try to sound professional.

    The document should start with the following header, including --- characters. Replace placeholders denoted by parentheses with the appropriate content from the issue.

    ---
    title: "Breaking change - (A concise descriptive title of the breaking change)"
    description: "Learn about the breaking change in (product/version) where (very brief description)."
    ms.date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US')}
    ai-usage: ai-assisted
    ms.custom: ${issueUrl}
    ---

    After the header, include the following sections in this order. Use the description in parentheses as a guide for the content of each section.

    - h1: "(The same title used in the document header, sans 'Breaking Change - ')"
      (An introductory paragraph summarizing the breaking change.)
    - h2: Version introduced
      (The version in which the breaking change was introduced.)
    - h2: Previous behavior
      (A brief description of the behavior before the change, including an example code snippet if applicable.)
    - h2: New behavior
      (A brief description of the behavior after the change, including an example code snippet if applicable.)
    - h2: Type of breaking change
      (The following sentence: "This is a []() change." where the link text is the type of breaking change from the issue. The link should point to ../../categories.md and add the appropriate bookmark from this list:
        - #behavioral-change
        - #binary-compatibility
        - #source-compatibility
      If the issue lists multiple types of breaking changes, create a single sentence that links to each applicable type, such as "This is both a []() and []() change.") If there are no types of breaking changes selected, write "TODO: Add type of breaking change."
    - h2: Reason for change
      (The complete reasoning behind the change, including any relevant links.)
    - h2: Recommended action
      (A brief description of the action or actions that users should take, including example code snippets if applicable.)
    - h2: Affected APIs
      (A bullet list of APIs that are affected by the change. If there are no affected APIs (or "No response") write "None.".)`
